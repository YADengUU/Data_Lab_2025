# Data Lab 2025
## Day 1- Introduction to PLINK and basic QC
Log into your UPPMAX Rackham account. The datasets for the lab are in the following directory on Rackham:
`/crex/proj/uppmax2024-2-1/DATA_LAB/data`.

In the terminal window, use the command line
```
data_loc="/crex/proj/uppmax2024-2-1/DATA_LAB/data"
```
and you can then access with `${data_loc}/` as the shortcut.
Do a quick check for the genetic variant information by
```
head ${data_loc}/epihealth.pvar | column -t
```

> For sample (participant) information, check epihealth.psam; donâ€™t do the same thing for epihealth.pgen, which is in compressed format and unreadable by humans.

### Question 1:
What is the chromosome number of SNPs in the dataset? In which column do you find this information?
